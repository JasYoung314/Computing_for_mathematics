\textbf{Company name:}\\

\textbf{Technical aspects:}\\

No details are given as to how you will code the app? I suggest taking a look at kivy.org.

If you don't actually code your app it's ok to just have the underlying Python code but what you are suggesting is potentially very basic so be sure to keep the marking criteria in mind.\\

\textbf{Initial comments about write up:}\\

Well written.\\

\textbf{Initial comments about strategy:}\\

Also, be sure to fortify your market research: I'm not convinced there is a need for this product.\\

\textbf{General comments}\\

See above.\\

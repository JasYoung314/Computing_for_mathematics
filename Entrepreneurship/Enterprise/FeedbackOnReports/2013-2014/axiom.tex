Axiom. \\

\textbf{Technical aspects:}\\

I'm not entirely sure what your problem is: a packing problem, a routing problem?\\
There is a \textbf{huge} amount of literature and research done on this in Mathematics (right here at Cardiff Dr. Thompson and Dr. Lewis are international experts in the field and might be worth talking to).
In particular you need to consider whether or not you are solving this optimally or heuristically (not feasible for NP-Hard problems).
There are a variety of algorithms for the second (ant-colony optimisation, tabu search etc...).
Some problems can be solved optimally: Sage has a mixed integer linear optimisation class that could be useful \textbf{but} I really like the idea of you guys using c++ for the engine with Python as the glue.\\

\textbf{Initial comments about write up:}\\

Well written.\\

\textbf{Initial comments about strategy:}\\

Need to consider this carefully, at the moment it's a bit abstract I approximative.\\

\textbf{General comments}\\

Define your product slightly better but otherwise I think this is a great idea.
I look forward to seeing the output.

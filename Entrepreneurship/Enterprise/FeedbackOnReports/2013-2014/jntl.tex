\textbf{Company name:}\\

\textbf{Technical aspects:}\\

Linear programming is a great mathematical topic to tackle.

Sage has a class for mixed integer linear programming (which encompasses base linear programming).
You could just use this and do all the business around it and/or at least verify that your coding is working.

If you do the latter you'll have to answer the question: why? (Given that Sage is open source it makes sense to use it and embed it in whatever you wanted to do).

\textbf{Initial comments about write up:}\\

Well written, good job.\\

\textbf{Initial comments about strategy:}\\

This is a very saturated market with multiple consultancy companies doing exactly what you suggest.

They charge a huge deal though so perhaps your usp could be that you're not expensive and concentrate on SMEs?\\

\textbf{General comments}\\

I look forward to seeing what you will come up with.

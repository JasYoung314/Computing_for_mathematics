\textbf{Company name:}\\

Ject. \\

\textbf{Technical aspects:}\\

You have not considered any technical aspects.
This is rushed and very poor.
As you plan on making this client side based (as opposed to being `in the cloud') you will need to learn how to code a GUI.

You do not know what Ruby is.
I'm not sure you know what LaTeX is.\\

\textbf{Initial comments about write up:}\\

This is rushed and mainly offers opinions.

Terribly referenced (if you attended Helen's lecture on referencing you most certainly did not listen).\\

\textbf{Initial comments about strategy:}\\

Not sure I see the strategy.
This needs to be addressed.\\

\textbf{General comments}\\

You have a lot of work to do.

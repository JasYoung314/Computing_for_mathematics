\textbf{Company name:}\\

UniMath. \\

\textbf{Technical aspects:}\\

I'm glad you mentioned javascript at some point as just using HTML would not be sufficient: HTML is not code it is just a markup language.

Take a look at css as well for the look of your website.\\

\textbf{Initial comments about write up:}\\

Well written.

\textbf{Initial comments about strategy:}\\

This is a very saturated market with multiple consultancy companies doing exactly what you suggest.\\
Do some work to identify your USP and how you  will differentiate.\\

\textbf{General comments}\\

I look forward to seeing what you will come up with.

\textbf{Company name:}\\

Vector. \\

\textbf{Technical aspects:}\\

Django is appropriate. It sounds like you've started gaining familiarity with it.

Be sure to look at css as well to make your templates `look nice'.\\

\textbf{Initial comments about write up:}\\

Read ok, process diagram was not helpful.\\

\textbf{Initial comments about strategy:}\\

This is a saturated market, I understand your usp but you need a bit more rigorous market research (`asked some people' is not enough).\\

\textbf{General comments}\\

Good luck with Django, if you'd like a hand come and speak to me.\\

\textbf{Company name:}\\

MIPE. \\

\textbf{Technical aspects:}\\

Not much thought has been given to the technical aspects of this work.
You state that you will use HTML: this will not contribute to the Code part of the mark as HTML is not a coding language but a markup language.
Also it won't be possible to have quizzes using HTML.
Take a look at javascript.

\textbf{Initial comments about write up:}\\

Poorly written with a lot of errors.

\textbf{Initial comments about strategy:}\\

Not very detailed but good use of resources to gain some knowledge about market.

\textbf{General comments}\\

A lot of work needs to be done on the coding aspect.
Take a look at Coursera and Udacity.

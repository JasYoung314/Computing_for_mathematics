\textbf{Company name:}\\

BNJJ. \\

\textbf{Technical aspects:}\\

Various things:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Facebook comments limits you, take a look at disqus.com which allows easy embedding of a discussion board in HTML and users can comment using Facebook, twitter, google and others.
    \item Using the drag and drop HTML creator will get you NO MARKS for code (as you are not coding). Be sure to take a look at the marking criteria (HTML does not count as code, it is just a markup language). Also (for info) there is better out there than Serif.
    \item Flash is a dying framework (too battery intensive for mobile devices), most modern sites use HTML5 and/or something like Django which lets you run stuff server side.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Initial comments about write up:}\\

Some opinions offered as facts.

\textbf{Initial comments about strategy:}\\

I like your usp, be sure to capitalise on it (perhaps even making some sort of moderated wiki).

\textbf{General comments}\\

Keep the marking criteria in mind and work on the technical aspects.

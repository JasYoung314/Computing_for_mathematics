\textbf{Company name:}\\

Batduck. \\

\textbf{Technical aspects:}\\

Not many details are given as to the actual technical aspects.

It sounds like Sage will allow you to do what you need though.

It sounds like you won't have time to train \textbf{actual} duck for the presentation so perhaps code some races with the random python library.

Come by for a chat if I can help with anything.\\

\textbf{Initial comments about write up:}\\

Well written and made me smile on a couple of occasions.
Be careful not to be too familiar.\\

\textbf{Initial comments about strategy:}\\

How will you train the ducks?
There are a bunch of ethical issues about encouraging kids to attend events that are financed through betting.
Make sure you consider them.

\textbf{General comments}\\

Think about the ethics and also about the ducks.

I very much look forward to seeing where this will go.

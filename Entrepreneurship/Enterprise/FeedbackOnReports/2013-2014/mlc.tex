\textbf{Company name:}\\

MLC. \\

\textbf{Technical aspects:}\\

Technical aspects sound well thought out although no details are given as to how you will build a website.

What sounds ideal is Django, you could create templates for content etc...

I understand that that might be technically difficult with how much time you have left so I'd suggest basic HTML with embedded Sage cells for illustrations.

You could also look to embed your own made YouTube clips (take a look at MOOCS like udacity and coursera).


\textbf{Initial comments about write up:}\\

Very well written.

\textbf{Initial comments about strategy:}\\

Excellently thought out, could benefit from a wider survey (perhaps put an online survey together?) and also a review of academic education literature.

\textbf{General comments}\\

As well as what I have suggested above I would speak to Dr Wilson (the director of the Maths support service, he would be delighted to speak to people about a subject he is passionate about).

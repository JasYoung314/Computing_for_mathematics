\textbf{Company name:}\\

Evolve \\

\textbf{Technical aspects:}\\

No technical details are given.\\

If you are just building a framework (so the Python code to handle the database of users and give betting advice) then you just need Python.\\

You talk about `progress' a lot but at the moment I have no idea what is meant by that.\\

If you want to build a website (and wanted to do it properly) you'd need something like Django to handle a database.\\

\textbf{Initial comments about write up:}\\

Too many mistakes: messy and confused.\\

\textbf{Initial comments about strategy:}\\

I am still unsure as to whether or not you have anything novel here.
What is your USP?
Mathematics is used throughout better, including basic probability (which is what you are talking about using) is not novel.

\textbf{General comments}\\

Poorly written and I am unsure as to whether or not you have a USP and further more if you have thought about technical aspects.

Also, you should be considering aspects such as gambling addiction (is this a `valuable' thing for society?) and the legal aspects (I am unaware of them but you need to know).

It is still early and you can address all these things.

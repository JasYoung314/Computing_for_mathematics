\textbf{Company name:}\\

RJSE. \\

\textbf{Technical aspects:}\\

Little to no technical details are given: you have very little time to accomplish a lot.

Take a look at kivy for app development but this might not be realistic given your time frames, as long as you have the skeleton code that is something.\\

\textbf{Initial comments about write up:}\\

Poorly written with opinions offered as facts.\\

\textbf{Initial comments about strategy:}\\

More market research needs to be done.\\

\textbf{General comments}\\

This has the potential to be neat. A lot of work to do.

Jenny Ca\$h \\

\textbf{Technical aspects:}\\

On a technical note you \textbf{will} need more than just HTML to get marks for code (HTML is not really code it's a markup language).\\

It sounds like you'd want to use Django but this might be a bit ambitious given the time you have left, in which case you can `just' have the working python code (which will eventually fit in Django).

Feel free to have a chat with me to clarify that.\\

\textbf{Initial comments about write up:}\\

Well written.\\

\textbf{Initial comments about strategy:}\\

\textbf{HUGE DISCLAIMER:} Be sure to cover yourself legally and ethically. Seeks some advice about the legality of your product (Neil might be able to help).

Also, consider ethical issues, your product encourages gambling: is that a good thing?

\textbf{General comments}\\

Be careful with legal aspects!

Consider technical points I mentioned above.

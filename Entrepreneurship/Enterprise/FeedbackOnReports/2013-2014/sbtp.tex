\textbf{Company name:}\\

SBTP. \\

\textbf{Technical aspects:}\\

You keep on referring to a `fair' system yet you have not defined what is meant by `fair'.
Mathematically this is a very complex subject and you would need to do a lot more work and research to justify using supplementary votes.

On a technical note, your project at present reduces to a single if statement...

\textbf{Initial comments about write up:}\\

Terms are not well defined.

\textbf{Initial comments about strategy:}\\

You have not convinced me that there is a problem that needs solving.

\textbf{General comments}\\

Gain familiarity with mathematics of voting: a complicated problem.
Defining `fairness' is not straightforward.

Ensure there is a market for your product and finally give some thoughts towards the technical aspects.

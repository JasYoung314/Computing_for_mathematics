\textbf{Company name:}\\

Serendipity. \\

\textbf{Technical aspects:}\\

You have thought about sorting algorithms but will in fact need matching algorithms.
Take a look at the Gale Shapley algorithm (some great videos on YouTube about it).
Also, I have some open source code online that you could modify.

Big question is how will you build the app?
You might not have time to get that done by the deadline so make sure you think about it, in particular what is your plan if you don't have time?

\textbf{Initial comments about write up:}\\

Very well written.\\

\textbf{Initial comments about strategy:}\\

How will you enter a saturated market?

\textbf{General comments}\\

Have a look at my suggestion re matching algorithms.

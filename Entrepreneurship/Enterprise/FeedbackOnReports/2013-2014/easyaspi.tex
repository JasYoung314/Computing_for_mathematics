\textbf{Company name:}\\

Easy as Pi. \\

\textbf{Technical aspects:}\\

All well thought out but you are missing a major component: code.

HTML is a markup language and doesn't `count' as code as far as the course is concerned. You have various things you could do:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Django (this is how I would recommend building the website if it was to be a `real' product);
    \item javascript (a language that browsers can interpret);
    \item Include embedded Sage cells to help illustrate things (easiest thing to do as you can just embed them in your plain HTML).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Initial comments about write up:}\\

No context given to the process diagram and the pseudo code was a bit nonsensical.

\textbf{Initial comments about strategy:}\\

I like your usp.

\textbf{General comments}\\

Concentrate on technical aspects as well as specifying your strategy.

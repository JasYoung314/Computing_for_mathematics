\textbf{Company name:}\\

Promis \\

\textbf{Technical aspects:}\\

No technical details what so ever are given.

Are you actually going to code a website or a gui?

If the first, you will need to learn some basic javascript (potentially django but that might be too advanced given your time constraints).

If you want to build a gui you will need to learn how to use wxypython.

Game development is difficult. Take a look at `Python for kids' (a book).
You also mention in your report that you would potentially have players playing online against each other: that is very tricky to get right.\\

\textbf{Initial comments about write up:}\\

Messy, unclear and mainly offers opinion.

\textbf{Initial comments about strategy:}\\

I am not sure you have a strategy and am not in fact sure you know how to do what you want to do.

\textbf{General comments}\\

You should clearly agree on tasks that need to be completed in the coming weeks: agree on a strategy (have a go at a business canvas), agree on the technical aspects and get going.

\textbf{Company name:}\\

HSPL. \\

\textbf{Technical aspects:}\\

Little to no details about technical aspects are given: how will you code the app?

If you plan on actually putting an app together take a look at kivy.
If not and you will just built the code underneath then python and matplotlib will be sufficient.

I'm curious how you will maintain a database with all the info?\\

\textbf{Initial comments about write up:}\\

Extremely poorly written in some section. Grammatical mistakes and at some point unreadable. Make sure you proof read your work.\\

\textbf{Initial comments about strategy:}\\

I like the idea, some more Market research with regards to how likely people are to use your product will be welcome?

Also, how would you get the necessary data?\\

\textbf{General comments}\\

Concentrate on the technical aspects but keep in mind some of the questions about strategy.

Write better.

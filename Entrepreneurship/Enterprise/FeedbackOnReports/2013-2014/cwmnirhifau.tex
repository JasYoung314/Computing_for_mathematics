\textbf{Company name:}\\

Cymni Rhifau \\

\textbf{Technical aspects:}\\

You plan on building a basic database of questions using Python.

I think this if within your technical ability and also thought your pseudocode and flow diagram was clear.

You comment that having a non-based cloud based system is a strength.
I am not sure I agree.
I would rather use a website than a piece of software that I need to install, you need to justify this approach as a strength and not a weakness.

How will you build a GUI? Package the software? Compatibility with multiple operating systems etc...\\

\textbf{Initial comments about write up:}\\

Well written.\\

\textbf{Initial comments about strategy:}\\

See my earlier comment about cloud vs non cloud based software.
Think about channels for distribution?\\

\textbf{General comments}\\

Well written, some important ideas need to be consider before making progress (see earlier comments).

Think about your strategy and make sure you get going on technical aspects.

\textbf{Company name:}\\

RACH. \\

\textbf{Technical aspects:}\\

You have given no technical details as to how you will manage what you're trying to manage.

You will most probably need Mathjax (a server that renders LaTeX code) or you would have to send bitmap/png across a network.

\textbf{Initial comments about write up:}\\

Well written but missing details as to why this is needed (a majority of 30 students saying they would use it is not enough)?

\textbf{Initial comments about strategy:}\\

I am not convinced there is a need for this. Loads of great online solutions for sharing mathematics that are all accessible on phones so I don't see the need and/or the benefits...

\textbf{General comments}\\

Technically this is difficult, you have a lot of work to do to find out if it is possible. You need to do a lot more market research to see if this is actually useful.

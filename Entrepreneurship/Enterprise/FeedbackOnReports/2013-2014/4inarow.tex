\textbf{Company name:}\\

4 in a row. \\

\textbf{Technical aspects:}\\

It sounds like you are only planning on building a website using plain HTML.
Note that this will not contribute to any `code' for the project as HTML is just a mark up language.
Either use something like Django but that might be a bit complicated given how much time you have left or at least incorporate some javascript.\\

\textbf{Initial comments about write up:}\\

Not much detail and your 'market research' is poor: only anecdotal evidence.\\

\textbf{Initial comments about strategy:}\\

Not much written to comment on.\\

\textbf{General comments}\\

You need to concentrate on the code as well as actually define a strategy.\\

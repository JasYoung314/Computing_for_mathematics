\textbf{Company name:}\\

Dot. \\

\textbf{Technical aspects:}\\

You have considered these and explained them well.
Take a look at databases (something like mysql).

Also, the main technical aspect that is lacking is how you would actually code an app.
Whether or not you have time to do this in the time you have left is questionable (it's hard) but it might be worth you taking a look at kivy.
If you don't have time but have the skeleton working (like your pseudo code) that's awesome.\\

\textbf{Initial comments about write up:}\\

Very well written: great job!\\

\textbf{Initial comments about strategy:}\\

Some of the pricing seems high and you are entering in what I personally believe to be a saturated market but everything as been well thought out: good job.

\textbf{General comments}\\

Great report. I would like to use this as a showcase for future years if that is ok with you.

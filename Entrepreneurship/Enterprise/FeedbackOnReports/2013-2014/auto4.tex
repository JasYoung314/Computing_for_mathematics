\textbf{Company name:}\\

Hakan, Ruidi and Rebecca. \\

\textbf{Technical aspects:}\\

I have looked at both your reports, both had planned to build an education website.

Think about the code needed to do this:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Django (hard but well suited)
    \item javascript (easier but not as powerful).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Initial comments about write up:}\\

Detailed but some grammatical error on the one written by Ruidi.\\

\textbf{Initial comments about strategy:}\\

Think hard about your usp?\\

\textbf{General comments}\\

Keep the marking criteria in mind.

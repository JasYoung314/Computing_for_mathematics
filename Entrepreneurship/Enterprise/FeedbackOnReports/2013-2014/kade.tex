Kade. \\

\textbf{Technical aspects:}\\

I have no knowledge of mobile app development but take a look at kivy.org which allows you to use python to build apps.

The idea sounds great and there might be some cool mathematics to look at as well.

\textbf{Initial comments about write up:}\\

Very well written.

\textbf{Initial comments about strategy:}\\

\textbf{General comments}\\

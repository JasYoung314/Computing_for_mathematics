\textbf{Company name:}\\

Alpha1 \\

\textbf{Technical aspects:}\\

Sounds like you plan on writing 1 line of Sage code but the app aspect is more complicated.

We have talked already about kivy which is what I believe you should look at.\\

\textbf{Initial comments about write up:}\\

Poorly written with lots of repetition (you told me that you were choosing to build an app 12 times).\\

\textbf{Initial comments about strategy:}\\

Not convinced that this is a useful product and that it will be popular (as a lecturer I would never recommend it).\\

\textbf{General comments}\\

Re strategy you need to do some work to justify that there is a market for your product. I am not convinced.

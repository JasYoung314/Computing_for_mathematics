\textbf{Company name:}\\

JJSL. \\

\textbf{Technical aspects:}\\

Use of Django is appropriate. Do not leave it too late to make sure you are comfortable with the software.\\

\textbf{Initial comments about write up:}\\

Well written.\\

\textbf{Initial comments about strategy:}\\

Not entirely sure there will be a market for it (student connect via facebook no? - I am old boring and don't know but your report still did not convince me.)

Where how will you get your website content?\\

\textbf{General comments}\\

I look forward to seeing what you will come up with.

Be sure to get going on Django sooner rather than later.

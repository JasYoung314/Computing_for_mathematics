\textbf{Company name:}\\

Nineties. \\

\textbf{Technical aspects:}\\

Very little details about technical aspects.

I would suggest concentrating on code to generate random questions for now.\\

To build the actual website you'd want to look at Django but you might not have time to get that done before the deadline.\\

\textbf{Initial comments about write up:}\\

Ok.

\textbf{Initial comments about strategy:}\\

Not entirely sure your idea is original and that you will be able to ensure correct answers are given. Also, how will you ensure that the place will be friendly: the internet is a mean place - the main weapon sites use to get away from this is to not allow anonymity.
Youtube comments are an excellent example for this, traditionally they are renowned to be extremely non-friendly places. Google are trying to address this by not allowing anonymous comments (it's easy to be mean if no one knows who you are).  \\

\textbf{General comments}\\

Be sure to concentrate on technical aspects and try and precise your usp a bit more.

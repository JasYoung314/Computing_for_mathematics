Good thought out idea guys.
I like that it's open source.

I very much liked your problem solving approach to getting data.

One thing missing was a more thorough validation of your approach (a shame to only show one week).\\

\textbf{Code: 75}\\

Your code is adequate for what you were hoping to do.
When/if you `go global' there are various skills you would need to learn (I'd recommend Django).\\

\textbf{Delivery: 75}\\

Really good delivery.
Great start to the presentation to ask the audience questions: well done.

I also liked the self depreciating humour.
Note however that this might not always be the case: it's important to know your audience.
In this case you knew your audience and it went down well I'm just offering this as feedback/advice for your next presentation.\\

\textbf{Visual Aids: 75}\\

Good use of visual aids.\\

\textbf{Creativity: 80}\\

Great idea.\\


\textbf{General comments}\\

Well done on this guys.
I think you could use more thorough statistical methods in the future (although you have perhaps not learnt them yet).\\

\textbf{Overall Mark: 77/100}

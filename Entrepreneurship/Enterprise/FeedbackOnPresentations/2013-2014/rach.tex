These seemed rather unfinished.
Your problem was well introduced although I am not sure you offered the correct solution.\\

\textbf{Code: 65}\\

Basic use of code.
Generating symbols is not the correct way to go.
You want to generate the correct LaTeX code and then use either a phone based LaTeX server or Mathjax.\\

\textbf{Delivery: 67}\\

Could have been better rehearsed.\\

\textbf{Visual Aids: 65}\\

Ok use of visual aids.\\

\textbf{Creativity: 75}\\

Nice idea.\\

\textbf{General comments}\\

Seems like this was all left a bit late.\\

\textbf{Overall Mark: 66/100}

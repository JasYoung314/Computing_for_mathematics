The game aspect is great for this.
You could have considered certain things a bit better (gambling market or not?).\\

\textbf{Code: 68}\\

Nice use of code to solve a hard problem.
A shame that you did not solve the dealer problem.\\

\textbf{Delivery: 74}\\

Very well delivered with a great introduction.

On a slight personal feedback note: Lydia you spoke very quietly, try to assert your presence a bit more during presentations.\\

\textbf{Visual Aids: 64}\\

Some of your images were fuzzy.\\

\textbf{Creativity: 62}\\

Neat idea.\\

\textbf{General comments}\\

Nice idea although some things could have been done in more detail.
Good job.\\

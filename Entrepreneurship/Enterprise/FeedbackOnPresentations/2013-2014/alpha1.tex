Excellent job guys.
As you know, I am not a fan of your product.
I am still not a fan of your product \textbf{but} that is not important.
You did a great job showing that their is a market for it with a nice touch to get quotes from actual lecturers.
This in essence shows that my opinion is a minority one: good job.

You also described the problem \textbf{very very} well.\\

\textbf{Code: 85}\\

Nice piece of coding.

It's a shame you couldn't get the interface working completely.
I know from your minutes that you were thinking about it the right way (calling Sage as a library).
Perhaps we could use code club next year to work on getting this working.\\

\textbf{Delivery: 82}\\

Excellent delivery.
Alex you gave a brilliant introduction and as a group you all came across very well.
You obviously prepared well for this and it came across: good job!\\

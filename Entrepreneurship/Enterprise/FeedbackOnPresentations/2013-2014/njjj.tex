\textbf{Content: 70}\\

Your content was extensively thought out.
Perhaps more could have been done with regards to your business model.\\

\textbf{Code: 90}\\

Excellent thorough use of code.
Particularly nice to see you using code to analyse the data from your questionnaire.\\

\textbf{Delivery: 85}\\

Excellent delivery.
You all came across very well and obviously prepared well.
Well done on dressing smart: it's important.\\

\textbf{Visual Aids: 70}\\

Good use of visual aids.\\

\textbf{Creativity: 70}\\

Whilst the `for students by students' is a great idea it is also rather safe.
I don't think that means it's bad but at the same time I cannot offer you more marks for creativity.\\

\textbf{General comments}\\

Really great job guys.
I hope you guys keep going and would love to point at your site from mine.
If I can help in any way let me know.\\

\textbf{Overall Mark: 77/100}

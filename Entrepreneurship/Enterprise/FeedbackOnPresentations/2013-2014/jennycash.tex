Well done on this guys.
A great idea but perhaps some better business strategic ideas were missing from the presentation.\\

\textbf{Code: 95}\\

Well done, a nice problem and well coded.\\

As a next step I would suggest making use of kivy to start developing this as an app.\\

\textbf{Delivery: 76}\\

Good delivery but perhaps at times the style was a bit too `relaxed'.\\

\textbf{Visual Aids: 97}\\

BRILLIANT video! I keep showing it to people saying `have you seen this awesome thing my students did?'.

\textbf{Creativity: 97}\\

Very creative: well done!\\


\textbf{General comments}\\

Excellent job guys.\\

My main concern remains the legality issues, I'd encourage you to keep going with this but keep in mind that you must take care with products that are ethically questionable.\\

I'd suggest that your next step be to get this in app form also, why don't you put the code up on github? (I'd like to contribute)
Happy to help if I can.\\

\textbf{Overall Mark: 87/100}

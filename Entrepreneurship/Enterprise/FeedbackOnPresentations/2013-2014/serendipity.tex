Serendipity\\

\textbf{Content: 65}\\

Nice idea although at one point slightly confused (dating site or social network?).
Kieran did a great job answering questions in a very clear way although perhaps more preparation would have removed the need for these questions.\\

\textbf{Code: 55}\\

Very basic code used.
A poor understanding of a more appropriate algorithm was shown in the presentation.
Whilst the Gale-Shapley algorithm can gives matchings were some individuals have their least preferred choice, this matching will be stable in terms of no other preferred choice prefers them.
More time spent understanding this algorithm (used to assign matching of organs to organ transplant patients) would have been worthwhile.
As it stands your code just carries out some basic data manipulation.  \\

\textbf{Delivery: 65}\\

Good delivery but nervous.
I would recommend more preparation for future talks.\\

\textbf{Visual Aids: 56}\\

Basic visual aids.\\

\textbf{Creativity: 78}\\

Very nice idea.\\

\textbf{General comments}\\

Nice idea, the code was quite basic but well done on getting something done.\\

\textbf{Overall Mark: 62/100}

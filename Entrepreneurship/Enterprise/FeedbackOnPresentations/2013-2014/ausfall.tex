\textbf{Company name:}\\

Ausfall\\

\textbf{Content: 55}\\

Ok idea with very basic market research carried out.
Big weakness is (as I pointed out) the potential for errors in your materials.
Perhaps building a learning community would be a better idea?\\

\textbf{Code: 59}\\

Very basic code used.\\

\textbf{Delivery: 50}\\

This is the big weak point of your project.
Some of you presented well whilst others came across extremely relaxed (too relaxed) and not in a professional manner.
Similarly it's a great shame that you were talking amongst yourself during the talk itself.\\

\textbf{Visual Aids: 56}\\

Basic visual aids.\\

\textbf{Creativity: 60}\\

Ok idea.\\

\textbf{General comments}\\

The presentation should have been better rehearsed.
You came across as not caring about the project.\\

\textbf{Overall Mark: 56/100}

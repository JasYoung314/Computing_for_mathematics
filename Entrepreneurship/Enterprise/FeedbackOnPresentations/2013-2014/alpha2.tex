Market research and business strategy were not as well considered as the rest of the project here.

Another big thing missing is that a user does not get anything back from using your website.
At the moment it is just a data collector where you are kindly asking users to give you information.
My suggestion to have a random match play using a simple random number generator so that the player is in effect `betting' on a match (as well as providing you data) is one way of doing this.\\

Excellent piece of coding work.

Great job learning not only Django but also making your project open source and learning git + github.\\

\textbf{Delivery: 73}\\

Not a seamless presentation with some questions being left unanswered (mainly coding based questions).
You could have prepared better for this.

\textbf{Visual Aids: 80}\\

Good use of visual aids.

\textbf{Creativity: 100}\\

Very creative: well done!\\


\textbf{General comments}\\

Excellent piece of code.
Well done!

I hope it doesn't die and you keep working on the various pieces that could make this a fun website to use.\\

\textbf{Overall Mark: 86/100}

<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Write a 3 page report on a mathematical topic. Your report is to be written in LaTeX and must use aspects of programming (Python and/or Sage) to illustrate the particular topic.</p>
<p><em>You are encouraged to choose a topic</em>, if you do so I recommend checking with me (Vince Knight) that the topic is appropriate. If you are unable to choose a topic select one from the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Convergence of sequences,</li>
<li>Complex numbers,</li>
<li>Solving differential equations,</li>
<li>Random events in probability.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="marking-scheme">Marking scheme</h2>
<p>The following marking scheme will be applied:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Code</strong> (50% weighting)
<ul>
<li>50%: Appropriate code used with concepts learn in lab sheets.</li>
<li>70%: Code from lab sheets used to demonstrate concepts clearly.</li>
<li>90%: Code used is a combination of code learnt in class and individually researched. Used to explain concepts in a clear and original way.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Content</strong> (30% weighting)
<ul>
<li>50%: The content is correct and basic aspects of the topic are explained.</li>
<li>70%: The content is correct and some research has been undertaken to show interesting aspects of the topic.</li>
<li>90%: The topic chosen is very original and a great understanding is shown.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Presentation</strong> (20% weighting)
<ul>
<li>50%: The work is well written with no or little graphical content and also contains grammatical and spelling mistakes.</li>
<li>70%: The work is well written with some graphs and images and minor grammatical and spelling mistakes.</li>
<li>90%: The work is clear, well written with excellent quality graphs and images with no grammatical and spelling mistakes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

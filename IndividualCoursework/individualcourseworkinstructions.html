<h1 id="computing-for-mathematics-individual-coursework">Computing for Mathematics: individual coursework</h1>
<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Write a 3 page report on a mathematical topic. Consider the target audience of your report to be first year mathematics students wanting to learn about a given topic. Your report is to be written in LaTeX and must use aspects of programming (Python and/or Sage) to illustrate the particular topic.</p>
<p><em>You are encouraged to choose your own topic</em>, if you do so I recommend checking with me (Vince Knight) that the topic is appropriate. If you are unable to choose a topic select one from the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Convergence of sequences,</li>
<li>Complex numbers,</li>
<li>Solving differential equations,</li>
<li>Random events in probability.</li>
</ul>
<p>You are encouraged to include the code used as an appendix (if you use Sage, including a link to a published sheet is appropriate).</p>
<h2 id="marking-scheme">Marking scheme</h2>
<p>The following marking scheme will be applied:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Code</strong> (50% weighting)
<ul>
<li>50%: Appropriate code used with concepts learnt in lab sheets.</li>
<li>70%: Code from lab sheets used to demonstrate concepts clearly.</li>
<li>90%: Code used is a combination of code learnt in class and individually researched. Used to explain concepts in a clear and original way.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Content</strong> (30% weighting)
<ul>
<li>50%: The content is correct and basic aspects of the topic are explained.</li>
<li>70%: The content is correct and some research has been undertaken to show interesting aspects of the topic.</li>
<li>90%: The topic chosen is very original and a great understanding is shown.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Presentation</strong> (20% weighting)
<ul>
<li>50%: The work is well written with no or little graphical content and also contains grammatical and spelling mistakes.</li>
<li>70%: The work is well written with some graphs and images and minor grammatical and spelling mistakes.</li>
<li>90%: The work is clear, well written with excellent quality graphs and images with no grammatical and spelling mistakes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>A model solution is available <a href="http://goo.gl/ly8fdG">here</a>.</p>
<p>How the model solution would have been marked is <a href="https://www.writelatex.com/read/qcjzqvbrmsfq">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="submitting">Submitting</h2>
<p>Deadline for this work to be handed in is <em>Thursday of Week 11</em>.</p>
<p>You will submit this work in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Via learning central using turnitin. Find the assessment section of the Computing for Mathematics module. You will <strong>only</strong> submit the pdf this way and turnitit will check it for plagiarism. <strong>You will only be able to do this once!</strong></li>
<li>Put <strong>all your files</strong> (.tex, .pdf, .py, .sws etc...) in a folder named <code>studentnumber</code> (<strong>YOUR STUDENT NUMBER</strong>). Place this folder in the directory named: <code>MA1003 Coursework</code> in the Shared Drive. <strong>Importantly: this directory has particular read and write permissions so you will only be able to do this once!</strong></li>
</ul>
